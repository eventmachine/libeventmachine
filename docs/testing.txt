We can use the test support in Automake along with assert() etc to do our testing.
It simply builds and executes specified files and ensures that they give OK return 
values. If not, the test is considered to have failed.

Running 'make check' runs the tests.

This is a basic Makefile.am example for the tests/ directory:

// This is a list of files to be executed as tests. Without any other options,
// they are considered to be directly executable.
TESTS = check_basic

// Anything prefixed with 'check_' is only performed during a 'make check'.
// These are the same as any other Makefile.am dependencies with that exception.
// Our tests will need the public header and link against the built library.
check_PROGRAMS = check_basic
check_basic_SOURCES = check_basic.c $(top_builddir)/src/eventmachine.h
check_basic_LDADD = $(top_builddir)/src/libeventmachine.la
